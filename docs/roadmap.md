# Roadmap

Here's the current plan for Cthulhu. The current version is still pre 0.1.

* [x] [0.1] interpreter and most prominent API calls available
* [x] [0.2] create an actual JavaScript API and not simply global methods
* [x] [0.3] replication
* [ ] more examples
* [ ] blocking calls/background processing
* [ ] functions with variable argument number
* [ ] return type to redis should be specific and not string
* [ ] support for generic LUA style calls (`RedisModule_Call`)
* [ ] support for manual replication
* [ ] more Redis API if needed
* [ ] support for pub/sub callbacks
